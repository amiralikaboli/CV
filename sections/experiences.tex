\textcolor{gray}{I have worked in Hezardastan Group since Oct 2019. It contains \href{https://cafebazaar.ir/app?l=en}{Cafe Bazaar(local app store with more than 45M active users)}, \href{https://divar.ir/s/tehran}{Divar(buy \& sell advertisements platform with more than 35M users)}, \href{http://sotoon.ir/}{Sotoon(cloud \& AI services provider)}.
In Sotoon, I have prepared codes and trained models for production as microservices on distributed systems.
In Cafe Bazaar, I have worked on improving an apps recommender system that contains recommendation and ranking parts. It has been evaluated by both hit-rate and user engagement metrics.}
